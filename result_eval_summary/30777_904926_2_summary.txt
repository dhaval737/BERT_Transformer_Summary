Return on sales  increased to 18.0% from 16.6%. ” S. C. Harris Group Chief Executive Overview Bodycote reported revenue growth of 14.9% to £690.2m (2016:  £600.6m), with revenue benefiting from foreign exchange translation  gain. At constant currency, revenues grew 9.6%, including a  contribution of 2.9% from acquisitions completed in 2016. The Group’s revenue growth, combined with continued discipline on  costs, helped lift headline operating profit by 24%. General industrial markets returned to growth after a multi- year negative trend. In total,  revenues from the energy sector increased by 4%. Civil aviation grew 6% with our UK operations continuing to add  significant business. The following review reflects constant currency growth rates unless  stated otherwise. Group revenues generated from  the general industrial sectors, which represent some 39% of  our business, grew 10%, which was well above the growth in  background demand. Moreover, this growth was broad-based,  with improvements in general industrial demand occurring in  all of our served geographies. This increase will require new facilities to  be built in 2018 in the UK in order to service forecast demand. Of this growth, 4 percentage points came  from acquisitions made in 2016. The decision we took to preserve the capacity at our T exas/Oklahoma  facilities is being well rewarded, as we have also seen a reversal of  the sharp declines that we had experienced in onshore oil & gas  demand. In the rest of the energy sector, subsea  revenues continued to decline and large-frame industrial gas turbines  (IGT) are also in retreat following cutbacks at the original equipment  manufacturers (OEMs). It is worth noting, however, that requests for  quotation in the subsea sector have picked up considerably.
