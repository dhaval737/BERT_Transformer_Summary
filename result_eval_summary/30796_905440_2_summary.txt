Strategy implementation Four years ago we undertook an extensive  strategic review and developed our strategy  for growth, the aim of which is to deliver  self-generated growth that outperforms our  markets. This “self-generated” element of our  business, combined with the high proportion  of sales that derive from end users’  maintenance and operating budgets, and  the wide diversity of the markets we serve,  both geographically and by industry sector,  makes our business highly resilient, although  not immune, to the vagaries of the markets. We identified six Group strategic  themes, which help us to do better what we  already do well:  − increase direct sales effectiveness through  sector focus;  − develop the knowledge and skills of our  expert sales and service teams;  − broaden our global presence;  − leverage R&D investments;  − optimise supply chain effectiveness; and  − operate sustainably and help improve our  customers’ sustainability. These priority  sectors now represent almost 50% of  the division’ s sales, compared to 40% in  2014. In the  Spirax-Sarco Steam Specialties division,  the organic growth rate of these priority  sectors strongly outpaced the growth  rate of the other sectors. Also noteworthy, the strategically  prioritised Controls and Thermal Energy  Management (TEM) products, which  represent around 40% of sales and  are the main constituents of our self- generated solution sales, are growing at  a much faster pace than the traditional  Condensate Management products. During 2017, notable progress was made in  the implementation of our strategic priorities,  which was a significant contributing factor to  the good financial results and strong organic  growth achieved during the year:  − We continued increasing the alignment  between our direct sales force and our  target industries of Food & Beverage;  Healthcare; Pharmaceutical; Oil, Gas  & Chemical; and OEM customers,  supported by developments in our R&D  processes, manufacturing capabilities,  marketing and training materials.
