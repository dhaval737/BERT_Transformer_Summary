Rather, Half Year results’  statements are published on the Company’s website. Half Year Report Like many other listed public companies, we no longer circulate printed Half Year Reports to shareholders. We believe that this is of benefit to those shareholders who do not wish to be  burdened with such paper documents, and to the Company, as it is consistent with our target of saving printing and distribution costs. For general enquiries please call our Shareholder Services  helpline on: 0371 384 2018 (overseas holders need to call +44 (0)121 415 7047.
